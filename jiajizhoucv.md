## Working Experience

### Feb. 2015 - Now : Software Engineer, Hulu LLC.


### Apr. 2014 - Oct. 2014 : CTO & Dev Manager, miHoYo, Co. Ltd.

> miHoYo is a mobile game start-up established in 2012. I joined the team to help the team to grow and make development process more reliable. We created one of the most popular 2D action games in China called “The End of School 2” (or “Guns Girl” if you Google it), which was the 1st Top Paid game and 9th Top Grossing game in AppStore China. 
> 
> As Dev Manager, I set up release schedule, drive SCRUM meetings, make project plans and communicate with external partners to enable our game in global markets. As CTO I optimized the development process by introducing Git to replace the old version control system, building up an automated testing framework for backend service, setting up continuous integration to produce official releases, optimizing system architecture to improve performance.
> 
> I was also a developer and wrote code to implement game features, such as Facebook Sharing, in-game chatting and a lot of global market requirements.

### Jan. 2014 - Apr. 2014 : Senior Software Engineer, eBay Inc.

> I joined PaymentApps team in Managed Marketplace. PaymentApps team owns a part of the whole checkout process and some payment related integration services.
> 
> I contributed to the design and implementation of risk challenge system in the “progressive checkout” project. I designed the API interface and sequence diagram based on the architecture document and communicated with checkout team to integrate the service into checkout flow. I introduced AJAX + RESTful API style implementation to the team. I also introduced responsive web UI implementation to the team. I was also the code review master in the team to drive code review to achieve better code quality.

### May 2012 - Jan. 2014 : Software Developer III, Electronic Arts

> I joined Commerce and Identity team in EA Digital Platform division, which owns the service for billing, entitlement and authentication of EA games.
> 
> I was one of the main contributors of the horizontal scaling project. We designed a new data access layer and migrated all data from Oracle 11g to MySQL 5.5 with no downtime. The most important works I did are:
> 
- MySQL sharding framework design and implementation. I implemented several key features in the sharing framework including dynamic sharding configuration, global id generator, sharding annotation, best effort transaction management, etc.
- MySQL clusters deployment and administration. I was responsible for the MySQL HA architecture, performance tuning, deployment automation and database administration.
- Zero Downtime Oracle to MySQL data migration. I wrote the migration tool and designed the process to make it zero data loss and zero downtime for TB scale data.
- Billing data encryption/decryption service design and implementation. I designed and implemented the crypto service and the process of data migration.

> I was awarded the FY13 technical rock star because of the success of the migration project which increase the total capacity of the backend service by more than 8 times.

### Mar. 2011 - May 2012 : SDE, Microsoft

> I joined Microsoft Commerce Platform after graduation. The projects I worked on:
> 
- Windows Azure billing account migration. Windows Azure was originally on another payment platform in Microsoft, we migrated the whole billing account data from the original platform to the Commerce Platform and switched the users to our platform. I was one of the main contributors in the migration project. I helped the catalog team to understand the catalog model and subscription model discrepancies and implemented the subscription related data migration scripts.
- Batch job framework. In order to unify the existing batch jobs, we started a project to create a single batch job framework which fits all the existing jobs and provides easier configuration to run job distributed across a cluster. I designed and implemented the job configuration and execution flow and several core facilities in the framework.
- Scale-Out-Unit project. In order to make the system more scalable, we proposed a so called SOU architecture. I contributed to Account Migration Service, which can move one account from one database partition to another and make database more balanced.
