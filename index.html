<p>I joined Commerce and Identity team in EA Digital Platform division, which owns the service for billing, entitlement and authentication of EA games.</p>
<p>I was one of the main contributors of the horizontal scaling project. We designed a new data access layer and migrated all data from Oracle 11g to MySQL 5.5 with no downtime. The most important works I did were:</p>
<ul>
<li>MySQL sharding framework design and implementation. I implemented several key features in the sharing framework including dynamic sharding configuration, global id generator, sharding annotation, best effort transaction management, etc.</li>
<li>MySQL clusters deployment and administration. I was responsible for the MySQL HA architecture, performance tuning, deployment automation and database administration.</li>
<li>Zero Downtime Oracle to MySQL data migration. I wrote the migration tool and designed the process to make it zero data loss and zero downtime for TB scale data.</li>
<li>Billing data encryption/decryption service design and implementation. I designed and implemented the crypto service and the process of data migration.</li>

I was one of the main contributors in the migration project. The migration is extremely challenging due to two systems' radical differences on fundamental concepts such as offering model, billing and subscription cycle and bad legacy data. I helped the catalog team to understand the catalog and subscription model discrepancies and implemented the subscription related data migration code.</li>
<li>Batch job framework. We designed a batch framework to consolidate varies of batch executing jobs. I designed and implemented the job configuration and execution flow and several core facilities in the framework.</li>
